## 1. |[ DUALCORE::V3.0 ]|  
**Name:** DUALCORE SPECTRAL MATRIX  
**Entries:** 64  
**Type:** Oscillating dualities (wave-based)  
**Function:** Narrative, symbolic, and emotional modulation across media, character, logic, UI  
**Behavior:** Slidable from -1.0 to +1.0, influenced by LFO, RNG, environmental factors, and AI characters  
**Used In:**  
- Text generation shifts  
- Audio/visual modulation  
- Character behavior  
- Mood states  
- Ritual fusion triggers  

**Tag for notes:** `#dualcore_master`

## 2. |[ B1N4RY::M1RROR_T4BL3 ]|  
**Name:** BINARY MIRROR TABLE  
**Entries:** 32  
**Type:** Strict logic pairs (true/false, on/off)  
**Function:** Access gates, logic triggers, recursion locks, state switches  
**Behavior:** Mutually exclusive; cannot be modulated or fused  
**Used In:**  
- Ritual entry/denial  
- Narrative forks  
- Execution switches  
- Security toggles  

**Tag for notes:** `#binary_mirror`

## 3. |[ HYBRID::T0GGL3_T4BL3 ]|  
**Name:** HYBRID CONDITIONAL TOGGLES  
**Entries:** 15  
**Type:** Context-sensitive ritual states  
**Function:** Symbolic/mystical conditionals—midpoint states that reflect myth, emotion, or power  
**Behavior:** Not true switches or sliders; they respond to narrative logic, ritual state, or emotional tone  
**Used In:**  
- Story beats  
- Ritual threshold moments  
- Dreamstate modifiers  
- Emotional logic triggers  

**Tag for notes:** `#hybrid_toggle`

## 4. |[ DUAL::BINARY_PAIRS.v1.0 ]|  
**Name:** DUALITY–BINARY 2:1 PAIR MAP  
**Entries:** 32 mappings (64 dualities → 32 binaries)  
**Type:** Cross-link table  
**Function:** Bridges wave logic and control logic; pairs 2 dualities to 1 binary lock  
**Behavior:** Dualities must pass binary check to execute system action  
**Used In:**  
- Ritual locks  
- Fusion gates  
- Narrative consequences  
- Patch loading  

**Tag for notes:** `#dual_binary_bridge`

---

## 5. |[ SYNTHESIS::D34DR1NG ]| *(Visual schema placeholder)*  
**Name:** Dual-Ring Synthesis Diagram  
**Entries:** Visualized as two orbiting rings: DUALCORE and BINARY  
**Function:** Structural representation of the full modulation+control system  
**Used In:**  
- UI/UX modeling  
- Terminal visualization  
- Teaching the system to collaborators  

**Tag for notes:** `#synthesis_ring`

---

## 6. |[ RITUAL_ENGINE::FUSE_LOCK.v1.0 ]|  
**Name:** Ritual Logic Controller  
**Entries:** N/A (generative from dual+binary)  
**Type:** Dynamic ritual system combining wave modulation and binary test  
**Function:** Narrative triggers, spell structure, emotional logic layers  
**Used In:**  
- AI invocation  
- Thread transformation  
- Recursion breaks or amplifications  
- Fusion ritual gating  

**Tag for notes:** `#ritual_engine`

# ::NEXT ACTION — NOTES ARCHIVAL FORMAT::

Use the following tags as folders or subpages in Obsidian, Notion, Apple Notes, or wherever you archive:

- `#dualcore_master` → All 64 DUALCORE entries (grouped by domain, ID preserved)  
- `#binary_mirror` → Full 32-entry strict BINARY table  
- `#hybrid_toggle` → 15 hybrid toggles (veil, mirror, recursion, etc.)  
- `#dual_binary_bridge` → Full 2:1 mapping from DUALCORE to BINARY  
- `#synthesis_ring` → Visual map of double-ring logic (sketch placeholder or diagram to come)  
- `#ritual_engine` → Example syntax for ritual logic checks (fuse + lock)

::CONFIRMATION OPTIONS::

- Shall I now print each table **in full**, separated by tag, for copy-paste into notes?  
- Would you like a **print-ready markdown export batch**?  
- Or should we initiate a **template buildout** that lets you use these in creative or live projects?

Let me know how you want to **copy/lock/save** this.
