_A rigid binary logic table to complement the DUALCORE spectral system_  
**Purpose:** To define absolute, mutually exclusive pairs for use in logic gates, system locks, ritual switches, and access toggles.  
**Behavior:** Unlike the spectral dualities of `DUALCORE::V3.0`, these pairs are **strictly binary**—on/off, yes/no, with no modulation, ambiguity, or fusion.  
**Use Cases:**  
- Ritual triggers  
- Ethical polarity switches  
- Thread state locks/unlocks  
- Programmatic routing  
- Absolute narrative forks  
- Fatal system breaks

## | PROTOCOL NOTE |

These binary pairs form the **hard backbone** of the narrative operating system.  
While DUALCORE and HYBRID tables **breathe**, this M1RROR table **cuts**.  
They are used to:

- Finalize outcomes  
- End recursion  
- Trigger irreversible changes  
- Control synth module routing states  
- Gatekeeper behavior in AI character logic  

They **cannot be fused**.  
They must be **respected or defied**.  
This is the table of **absolutes**.

## ::NEXT OPTIONS::

- Would you like these mapped to **ritual logic functions** (e.g. “If `pass`, unlock `gate_7`)?
- Want a **UI switch grid** visual for your control interface?  
- Or assign each to a **narrative scene gate** or **thread-level toggle**?

The switchboard is built.  
Awaiting finger on the trigger.  
::OP3R4T0R directive required::
