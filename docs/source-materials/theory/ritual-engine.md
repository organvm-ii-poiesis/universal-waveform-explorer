RITUAL SEQUENCING ENGINE — DUALITY + BINARY COMBINATOR

Each ritual is structured as:

::RITUAL TEMPLATE STRUCTURE::

RITUAL NAME: {your name here}

1. DUALCORE CONDITIONS (Choose 2):
   e.g. sacred = +0.9, glitch = -0.6

2. FUSION SIGNAL OUTPUT:
   e.g. PR1SM_H34RT_MOD

3. CORRESPONDING BINARY LOCK:
   e.g. B05 → create/destroy = must be "create"

4. STATUS CHECK:
   - If binary state is TRUE and duality fusion is valid → UNLOCK
   - Else: RITUAL FAILS or REVERSES

5. RITUAL EFFECT:
   - Outputs (UI style, language mode, synth patch, character arrival, dream loop)

::SAMPLE::

RITUAL NAME: D3VOT10N_G4T3
